In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
A midnight sky, with stars above,
A celestial display, of endless love.

The trees stand tall, like sentinels of old,
Their branches swaying, to an ancient fold.
Their leaves rustle soft, a gentle breeze,
That stirs the earth, and brings us to our knees.

In this serene landscape, we find our peace,
A connection to nature's gentle release.
The wind carries scents, of blooming flowers,
And the sweet songs, of birds that soar.

The river flows, with a soothing song,
Its waters lapping, against the shore all day long.
The fish dart in, with a playful gleam,
As the sun sets low, and the stars beam.

In nature's beauty, we find our way,
Through life's complexities, to a brighter day.
A reminder of wonder, at the world around,
And the importance, of living life unbound.
