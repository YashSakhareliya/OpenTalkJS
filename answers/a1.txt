I'm an artificial intelligence model known as Llama. Llama stands for "Large Language Model Meta AI."I'm an AI assistant, which means I'm a computer program designed to simulate conversation and answer questions to the best of my knowledge. I don't have a personal identity or emotions like humans do, but I'm here to help with any information or tasks you might need assistance with.

I can provide information on a wide range of topics, from science and history to entertainment and culture. I can also help with language translation, text summarization, and even generate creative content like stories or poetry.
