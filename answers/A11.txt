Here are a few potential thesis statements:

1. "Through the use of symbolism and imagery, the poem explores the theme of love and relationships in a modern society."
2. "The poet's use of language and form creates a sense of melancholy and longing that reflects the speaker's emotional state throughout the poem."
3. "In 'Ode to a Nightingale,' John Keats employs the metaphor of nature to explore the human experience of mortality, loss, and the search for meaning."
4. "The poem's message about the importance of living in the present moment is undermined by the speaker's nostalgia for past love and experiences."
5. "Through its exploration of identity, culture, and social class, 'Song of Myself' offers a nuanced and complex portrait of American society."

Which one would you like me to expand on or help with?
